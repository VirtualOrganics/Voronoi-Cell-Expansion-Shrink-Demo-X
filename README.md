# Voronoi Cell Expansion-Shrink Demo X

An advanced physics-based demonstration of true Voronoi cell expansion and shrinkage through neighbor interaction. Unlike the original demo that simply moves cells around, this implementation creates genuine expansion effects where growing cells physically push their neighbors away.

## üéØ Overview

This demo implements a **physics-based expansion system** where Voronoi cells can truly expand or shrink by applying forces to their neighbors. This creates realistic growth dynamics where:

* Growing cells push neighboring cells away
* Shrinking cells pull neighbors closer
* The entire structure responds dynamically to changes
* Cell relationships are maintained throughout the transformation

## üîß The Physics-Based Growth Method

### Core Principle

In a true expansion system, growth must affect the surrounding environment. When a biological cell grows, it doesn't just move - it pushes against its neighbors, creating space for itself. This demo implements this natural behavior through a physics simulation.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. **Neighbor Detection**

The system first identifies which cells are neighbors by checking for shared Voronoi edges:

```javascript
// Cells sharing 2+ vertices share an edge in 3D
if (sharedVertices >= 2) {
    neighborCache.get(index1).add(index2);
    neighborCache.get(index2).add(index1);
}
```

#### 2. **Force Calculation**

Growing cells apply repulsive forces to their neighbors using an inverse square law:

```javascript
// Force is stronger when cells are closer
// and proportional to growth rate
const forceMagnitude = (growthRate * forceStrength) / (distance * distance);
```

Key parameters:
- **Growth Rate**: User-controlled via the Change slider (-10 to +10)
- **Force Strength**: Set to 2.0 for visible effects
- **Distance**: Euclidean distance between generator points

#### 3. **Physics Integration**

The system uses velocity-based physics with damping:

```javascript
// Update velocity with force (F = ma, assuming m = 1)
velocity.x += force.x * deltaTime;
velocity.y += force.y * deltaTime;
velocity.z += force.z * deltaTime;

// Apply damping for stability
velocity.x *= damping;
velocity.y *= damping;
velocity.z *= damping;

// Update position
newPosition = currentPosition + velocity * deltaTime;
```

#### 4. **Continuous Updates**

The physics engine runs continuously when Live Update is enabled:
- Forces are recalculated each frame
- Positions are updated based on accumulated forces
- Voronoi diagram is recomputed with new positions
- Visual feedback shows the dynamic changes

### Why This Method Works

1. **Physical Realism**: Mimics how real cells interact in biological systems
2. **Maintains Structure**: Cells remain connected as neighbors throughout
3. **Smooth Animation**: Physics integration creates natural motion
4. **Bidirectional Effects**: Both growth and shrinkage work naturally

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PhysicsExpansion.js**: Physics engine handling forces and motion
2. **DelaunayComputation.js**: Voronoi/Delaunay computation via WebAssembly
3. **Three.js**: 3D visualization and rendering

### Physics Engine Features

```javascript
class PhysicsExpansion {
    // Force parameters
    forceStrength = 2.0;    // Multiplier for force magnitude
    damping = 0.9;          // Velocity damping (0-1)
    maxForce = 0.1;         // Maximum force per frame
    minDistance = 0.01;     // Minimum distance to avoid singularities
    
    // State tracking
    forces = new Map();     // Per-cell force vectors
    velocities = new Map(); // Per-cell velocity vectors
    growthRates = new Map(); // Which cells are growing/shrinking
}
```

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Set Growth Rate**: User adjusts Change slider
2. **Calculate Forces**: Growing cell applies forces to all neighbors
3. **Update Velocities**: F = ma integration with damping
4. **Move Generators**: Update positions based on velocities
5. **Recompute Voronoi**: Generate new cell boundaries
6. **Render**: Display updated visualization

## üî¨ Mathematical Foundation

### Force Equation

```
F = k * g * (1/d¬≤) * nÃÇ

Where:
- F = force vector
- k = force strength constant
- g = growth rate (-10 to +10)
- d = distance between cells
- nÃÇ = normalized direction vector
```

### Velocity Integration

```
v(t+dt) = v(t) * damping + F/m * dt
p(t+dt) = p(t) + v(t+dt) * dt

Where:
- v = velocity
- p = position
- m = mass (assumed 1.0)
- dt = time step
```
